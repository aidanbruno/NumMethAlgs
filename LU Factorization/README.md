## LU Factorization ##
LU Decomposition with partial pivoting
## Inputs ##
- A = Coefficient Matrix
## Outputs ## 
- L = Lower Triangular Matrix
- U = Upper Triangular Matrix
- P = The Pivot Matrix

## Description ## 
When User inputs a sqaure matrix A, this function will decompose
A into L and U matricies, that when multiplied by the calculated 
P matrix, will return the user to the original A matrix
